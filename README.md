# HES-App
### Introduction
We are a small group of Ohio State Computer Science and Engineering majors working to build a mobile application for our student organization called
"Humanitarian Engineering Scholars." This group focuses on educating students on real world problems that need engineers to help to pave the way for a 
brighter future. This teaching portion of the group is coupled with real world opportunities to make an impact in the Columbus area and abroad.

### Mobile Application Details
Because our group is large and there are a lot of events and requirements to keep track of, our idea is create a mobile application that works as
a central hub of information for our group. Through this app, students can see all the events that are coming up and then they will be able to click
to sign up for these events. On the other end, our supervisor will be able to input new events, as well as keep track of how many people have signed up.
The idea is for this app to sync up with the HES calendar as well as the students' calendars.

### Further Aspirations
So many incoming lower classmen are so excited to learn how to do mobile development, but they either do not have the experience, or do not have the idea
and then they give up. This project will not only provide an easier, more fluent stream of information within the organization, it will also be a great
mentoring and learning platform for experienced developers and novice developers respectively.
